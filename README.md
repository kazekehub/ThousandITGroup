# ThousandITGroup

**The Movie News app shows a feed of films.
The application is made as a task for passing an interview in a  "Thousand IT Group" company.** <p>

Functional for implementation:
● Get a list of news and display the first records as a feed;
● The data must be cached to be displayed the next time the page is opened;
● If the news has a photo, then it must also be displayed in the feed;
● When scrolling to the end of the feed, you need to automatically upload more entries to the feed 
(Note: If the site does not allow loading news through pagination, when scrolling down the page, you can re-download news from the same source) 
[the second option was performed]
● When you click on the news, you need to open another page where you can read the details of the news; In the news details, you need to view all the data that is passed to the API;
● Support for screen orientation must be implemented;
● When swiping down (swipe), the data should be updated.
